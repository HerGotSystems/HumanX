## D-277A Audit Conclusion

D-277A confirmed:

- `packetId` is already returned by `GET /api/claims/:id` via `mapAnalysis()` (since D-275B)
- `packetId` is present in every `a` object received by `analysisItem()` — but not yet rendered
- Showing it to the owner is safe: `rp_*` format contains no PII (last 6 chars of claim ID + base-36 timestamp)
- Frontend-only implementation — no backend, schema, or API changes required
- Public profile (`/u/:slug`) confirmed unexposed: `loadPublicProfileSummary()` never calls `listAnalysisForClaim()`

---

## UI Change

**File:** `public/app-v10.js`
**Function:** `analysisItem()` (line 466)

**Insertion point:** After the existing `AI analysis of supplied HumanX packet — not independent verification.` disclaimer paragraph, before the `<div class="meters">` block.

**Change:**

```javascript
// Before:
<p class="small ev-origin-note">AI analysis of supplied HumanX packet — not independent verification.</p><div class="meters">

// After:
<p class="small ev-origin-note">AI analysis of supplied HumanX packet — not independent verification.</p>${a.packetId?`<p class="small ev-origin-note">Saved from RunPack: ${esc(a.packetId)}</p>`:''}<div class="meters">
```

**Behavior:**
- When `a.packetId` is non-null: renders `<p class="small ev-origin-note">Saved from RunPack: rp_...</p>`
- When `a.packetId` is null (historical rows, analyses saved before D-275D): renders nothing
- `esc()` applied to `a.packetId` — XSS safe
- No new CSS classes — uses existing `small` and `ev-origin-note`

---

## Why This Is Owner/Private Analysis View Only

`analysisItem()` is called only from `sectionAnalyses()`, which is rendered inside `renderStudy()`. The Study view is only accessible to authenticated users — it is not part of `renderPublicProfileHtml`. The `analyses` array is loaded from `GET /api/claims/:id`, which is an authenticated route. Public profile (`/u/:slug`) never calls `listAnalysisForClaim()` and does not receive analysis data at all.

The provenance line is therefore visible only to:
1. The claim owner in Study mode
2. Authenticated users with access to the claim's Study view

It is not visible on:
- Public profile `/u/:slug`
- Truth cards
- Review queue cards
- Any unauthenticated surface

---

## Public Profile Remains Unaffected

- `loadPublicProfileSummary()` uses count aggregates only — no analysis rows
- `renderPublicProfileHtml` does not call `sectionAnalyses()` or `analysisItem()`
- D-275B regression tests 13–15 (public profile exclusion locks) remain passing
- D-277B regression tests 8–9 add explicit `Saved from RunPack` boundary checks

---

## No Backend / Schema / API / Storage Changes

- `src/analysis-results.js` — not modified
- `src/worker.js` — not modified
- `migrations/` — not modified
- `GET /api/claims/:id` response shape — unchanged (already returned `packetId` since D-275B)
- `POST /api/analysis` route — unchanged

---

## No CSS Changes

- `public/styles.css` — not modified
- `public/index.html` — not modified
- Provenance line uses existing `small` and `ev-origin-note` classes only

## Tests Added

25 tests in D-277B block (`scripts/hardening-smoke-test.mjs`):

| # | Category | What is tested |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Frontend | `analysisItem` renders `Saved from RunPack:` |
| 2 | Frontend | Provenance line uses `a.packetId` |
| 3 | Frontend | `esc(a.packetId)` applied — XSS safe |
| 4 | Frontend | Provenance line is conditional — hidden when `packetId` absent |
| 5 | Frontend | Provenance line uses `ev-origin-note` and `small` classes |
| 6 | CSS lock | `styles.css` not modified by D-277B |
| 7 | Backend lock | `analysis-results.js` not modified by D-277B |
