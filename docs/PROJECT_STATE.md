## Identity

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Live app | https://humanx.rinkimirikata.com |
| Repo | HerGotSystems/HumanX |
| Worker entry | `src/worker.js` |
| Frontend | `public/app-v10.js`, `public/styles.css`, `public/index.html` |
| Belief Engine | `public/apps/humanx-belief-engine/index.html` (standalone) |

---

## Known-good static checks

Run before and after any change. All must pass with exit 0.

```sh
node --check public/app-v10.js
node scripts/hardening-smoke-test.mjs
node scripts/belief-engine-static-check.mjs
node scripts/worker-route-static-check.mjs
```

| Script | Expected |
|--------|----------|
| `node --check public/app-v10.js` | no output, exit 0 |
| `hardening-smoke-test.mjs` | `91 passed, 0 failed` |
| `belief-engine-static-check.mjs` | `24 passed, 0 failed (24 hard checks)` |
| `worker-route-static-check.mjs` | `35 passed, 0 failed (35 hard checks)` |

`MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning during hardening smoke is non-blocking.

---

## Current functional state

All flows confirmed working (code audit + static checks):

| Flow | State |
|------|-------|
| Submit Claim | → enters Review; exact duplicates return existing claim; near-duplicates submit with soft warning and `similar` badge in Review (D-10B/C/D) |
| Add Truth | → enters Review |
| Truth → Claim Review | converts truth to a pressure-testable claim in Review |
| Drift promote Truth | → enters Review |
| Drift promote Claim | → enters Review |
| Review approve / reject / keep | admin-only, all three paths functional |
| Review archive (cleanup) | admin-only, rejected smoke/test artefacts only |
| Evidence attach (side panel) | attaches to selected claim, recalculates score |
| Evidence Vault → Study Linked Claim | studyFromVault sets tab + mode correctly |
| Evidence Vault date display | shows `createdAt` from vault response (fixed B-3) |
| RunPack build / copy / download | functional; fallback pack generated locally if backend unreachable |
| Belief Engine → Send to HumanX | bridge sends snapshot via POST /api/belief-snapshots |
| Graph status box | live counts on Home, Claims, Truths, Vault |

---

## Backend / D1 safety rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Do not rerun migration 0004 | `migrations/0004_unique_normalized_content.sql` already applied to production. Rerunning will fail. |
| Do not rerun migration 0005 | `migrations/0005_add_home_tests_updated_at.sql` was manually applied via Cloudflare D1 console. Do not rerun unless the target DB is confirmed missing `home_tests.updated_at`. |
| `claims.near_duplicate_of` is live | Column added manually via Cloudflare D1 dashboard (D-10A). `idx_claims_near_duplicate_of` index also applied. Do not attempt to re-add either. |
| No Wrangler / D1 commands | `wrangler d1 execute`, `wrangler deploy`, and all variants are off-limits unless the user explicitly requests them. |
| No live write smoke | `scripts/write-endpoint-smoke-test.mjs` requires explicit per-session user approval. Do not run routinely. |

| C-11 | `b9918a0` | Modal hardening — replaced native `window.prompt` in report flow with `hxModal` in-app modal |
| D-1 | `53d3879` | Workspace-aware layout — sidebar context/casefile text now reflects the active mode in every workspace |
| D-2 | `437cbc3` | RunPack builder state — three-state layout (no claim / claim selected / pack generated) made explicit |
| D-3 | `e393512` | Evidence readability — JSON/object evidence body values rendered as readable text, not `[object Object]` |
| D-4 | — | Report reason visibility audit — confirmed `reports.reason` exists in schema; identified review queue gap |
| D-4B | `dd5a903` | Report reasons in review queue — correlated subquery adds `latest_report_reason` to both claims and truths queries; rendered in `reviewCard` and `renderReviewInspectPanel` (branch → PR #77 → merged) |
| D-5 | — | Claim normalization / intake audit — full audit of `renderSubmit`, `saveClaim`, `meaningKey`, duplicate detection; identified `data.existing` silent-lie bug and UX gaps |
| D-5B-1 | `5eb54d6` | Duplicate claim response fix — `saveClaim` now handles `data.existing: true` correctly; shows "already exists" panel with Study link instead of false "submitted for Review" |
| D-5C | `6ce3fb2` | Claim-writing guidance — collapsible writing-tips section (good/avoid examples), category suggestion chips, claim-type live hint below select |
| D-9A | `0430a88` | Reused-evidence compression — Study view collapses repeated evidence entries under a single source-claim header, eliminating redundant rows |
| D-9B | `7277f98` | Study evidence/pressure grouping — Study dock groups evidence and pressure blocks by linked claim for faster scanning |
| D-9B+ | `9044a07` | Evidence Vault grouping — Vault groups entries by linked claim with claim-level headers |
| D-9C | `1951f09` | Investigation Packet / RunPack workflow clarity — dock redesigned with explicit packet framing, AI-return parsing flow, and RunPack terminology consistency |
| D-10A | `579a783` | Near-duplicate migration plan — `docs/D10_NEAR_DUPLICATE_PLAN.md` created; manual D1 SQL documented; implementation plan for D-10B written |
| D-10B | `74b390c` (PR #78) | Near-duplicate suggestions Phase 1 — `meaningMatch` wired into `createClaim`; bounded 200-candidate scan; `near_duplicate_of` written on new claim only; `saveClaim` soft warning; `reviewCard` similar badge; inspect panel field |
| D-10C | `dcf4696` (PR #79) | Near-duplicate tuning — suffix normalisation (`-s`/`-ing`/`-ed`), contraction normalisation, additional stopwords; threshold 0.8 → 0.65; 10 new smoke checks (77 → 87) |
| D-10D | `dcf4696` | Negation/contradiction safety fix — contractions now normalise to `"not"` (not stripped); `"not"` kept as real token; negation-polarity guard in `meaningMatch`; min-overlap raised for 3-token claims; 2 new D-10D smoke checks (87 → 89) |
| D-11 | `1b41992` | Review moderation clarity — `~Similar` filter chip; amber `b-similar` badge; `review-card-similar` left-border; `~Similar` audit summary stat replaces always-zero Duplicates; `Similar claim (advisory)` inspect field label; advisory note banner in inspect panel; filter help and empty-state text for similar; no merge UI |
| D-11B | `b5fef36` | Fix review similar filter regression — `nearDup` was declared inside `else { }` block (D-11) but used in `return` template outside that scope; runtime `ReferenceError` silently broke all inspect, filter, and audit-toggle interactions; hoisted to function scope; 2 new smoke checks (89 → 91) |
| D-12 | `004f0b0` | Review queue scale/quality pass — sort controls (newest / oldest / reported first / ~similar first) added to filter bar; relative age display (`reviewAge`: "3d ago", "2h ago") replaces static date on review cards; no merge UI, no `duplicate_of` writes, no `review_state='duplicate'` |
| D-13 | `21e411a` | Advisory claim quality hints — frontend-only `claimQualityHints()` heuristic flags too-short, opinion-opener, absolute universal, common-knowledge, slogan/vague-framing, broad-actor, moral-label, and universal-scope patterns; live hints shown under claim input in Submit form; soft "needs sharpening" badge on Review cards; full hint list in Inspect panel; no blocking, no score changes, no backend/API changes |
| D-14 | `a12f394` | Review quality filter — `~Quality` filter chip and `~Quality first` sort option added to Review queue; both use `claimQualityHints()` to surface claims with advisory hints; chip count shown; help text and empty state added; advisory only — no blocking, no score changes, no backend/API changes |
| D-15 | `49db60b` | Review inspect navigation — position indicator (`N of M · X hints`) + Prev/Next buttons added below inspect panel close button; compact Approve/Keep Pending/Reject action bar added before the fields block; bottom action row preserved; no moderation behaviour changed; rejected: bulk actions, auto-advance, keyboard shortcuts, sticky panel, merge/suppress similar |
| D-16 | `5fd1b0a` | Study reused evidence compression — outer-collapse threshold lowered 10→4 (any 4+ reused items collapse into a closed `<details>` by default); ≤3 reused items switch from full `evidenceItem()` to compact rows inside `.reused-block`; `.study-sub-reused` styled muted/italic to read as secondary framing; D-16C (side panel grouping) deferred — patch functions use fragile selectors |

## Known limitations

**Live read smoke from Windows sandbox may fail.**
`scripts/read-endpoint-smoke-test.mjs` uses Node.js `fetch`, which inherits the Windows `schannel` TLS library. In sandboxed or restricted environments `schannel` cannot reach CRL/OCSP revocation servers, producing `CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK` and `fetch failed` for all HTTPS requests. This is a local TLS policy restriction, not an app failure. The live app is reachable (DNS resolves to Cloudflare). Run the live read smoke from a CI environment or a dev machine with unrestricted outbound TLS (e.g. GitHub Actions, WSL with curl's CA bundle).

---

## What is safe to do next

D-16 reused evidence compression is live. Claims with 4+ reused vault items now collapse into a closed `<details>` by default (was 10+). Claims with 1–3 reused items render compact rows inside a visually distinct `.reused-block` container instead of full-density `evidenceItem()` cards. Direct evidence remains primary; reused vault lineage is secondary and scanable. D-16C (side panel grouping) deferred.

Next work:

1. **Moderator merge UI** (only after extended usage audit) — a "Mark as duplicate of" action in the review inspect panel that writes `duplicate_of` and sets `review_state='duplicate'`. Backend + frontend; **branch + PR required**. Do not implement speculatively.
2. **RunPack provenance / versioning** (optional) — stamp generated packets with a claim snapshot hash and timestamp so AI analysis can be traced back to the state of the claim at generation time.
3. **Study dock refinements** (optional, after more use) — collect real usage feedback before further structural changes.

**Do not:**
- Speculatively refactor `src/worker.js` routing without a written plan reviewed first.
- Rerun migration 0004, 0005, or re-add `near_duplicate_of` column/index (see Backend / D1 safety rules above).
- Run live write smoke tests without explicit per-session approval.
- Merge any backend duplicate/near-duplicate work directly to main — always use a branch and PR.
- Write `duplicate_of` or set `review_state='duplicate'` without a dedicated moderator UI in place.
